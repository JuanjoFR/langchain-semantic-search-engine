This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About This Project

This project was created following the [LangChain official article](https://js.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/retrievers). It serves as a practice project for AI LangChain.

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. This project demonstrates how to build a semantic search engine using LangChain retrievers.
